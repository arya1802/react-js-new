            CARROM (also spelled carom) is a cue sport-based tabletop game of Indian origin. 
            The game is very popular in [Bangladesh] and Arabian countries the surrounding areas,
            and is known by various names in different languages. In South Asia, many clubs and 
            cafés hold regular tournaments. Carrom is very commonly played by families,

            CHESS is a two-player strategy board game played on a checkered board with 
            64 squares arranged in an 8×8 grid. The game is played by millions of people
            worldwide. Chess is believed to be derived from the Indian game chaturanga 
            sometime before the 7th century. Chaturanga is also the likely ancestor of 
            the Eastern strategy games xiangqi (Chinese chess), janggi (Korean chess), 
            and shogi (Japanese chess). Chess reached Europe by the 9th century, due 
            to the Umayyad conquest of Hispania. The pieces assumed their current powers
            in Spain in the late 15th century; the modern rules were standardized in
            the 19th century.

            TABLE TENNIS also known as ping-pong, is a sport in which two or 
            four players hit a lightweight ball back and forth across a table using 
            small rackets. The game takes place on a hard table divided by a net.
            Except for the initial serve, the rules are generally as follows:
            players must allow a ball played toward them to bounce one time 
            on their side of the table, and must return it so that it bounces 
            on the opposite side at least once. A point is scored when a player
            fails to return the ball within the rules.

            CRICKET  is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven 
            players on a field at the centre of which is a 20-metre (22-yard) pitch 
            with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three
            stumps. The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at the 
            wicket with the bat, while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent
            this and dismiss each player (so they are "out"). Means of dismissal
            include being bowled, when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the
                bails, and by the fielding side catching the ball after it is hit by
                the bat, but before it hits the ground. 

            FOOTBALL is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees,
            kicking a ball to score a goal. Unqualified, the word football 
            normally means the form of football that is the most popular where 
            the word is used. Sports commonly called football include association 
            football (known as soccer in some countries); gridiron football 
            (specifically American football or Canadian football); Australian
            rules football; rugby football (either rugby league or rugby union);
            and Gaelic football.[1][2] These various forms of football are 
            known as football codes.

            HOCKEYs a sport in which two teams play against each other by trying 
            to manoeuvre a ball or a puck into the opponent's goal using a hockey 
            stick. There are many types of hockey such as bandy, field hockey,
            ice hockey and rink hockey.  In most of the world, the term hockey
            by itself refers to field hockey,
            while in Canada, the United States, Russia and most of Eastern and 
            Northern Europe, the term usually refers to ice hockey.
